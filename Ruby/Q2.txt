HW 1-2: ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

In a game of rock-paper-scissors (RPS), each player chooses to play Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S). The rules are: R beats S; S beats P; and P beats R. We will encode a rock-paper-scissors game as a list, where the elements are themselves 2-element lists that encode a player's name and a player's selected move, as shown below:

[ ["Armando", "P"], ["Dave", "S"] ] # Dave would win since S > P

Part A: Write a method rps_game_winner that takes a two-element list and behaves as follows:

If the number of players is not equal to 2, raise WrongNumberOfPlayersError.
If either player's strategy is something other than "R", "P" or "S" (case-insensitive), raise NoSuchStrategyError.
Otherwise, return the name and move of the winning player. If both players play the same move, the first player is the winner.
We'll get you started:

class WrongNumberOfPlayersError <  StandardError ; end
class NoSuchStrategyError <  StandardError ; end

def rps_game_winner(game)
    raise WrongNumberOfPlayersError unless game.length == 2
    # your code here
end

Part B: We will define a rock-paper-scissors tournament to be an array of games in which each player always plays the same move. A rock-paper-scissors tournament is encoded as a bracketed array of games:

[
    [
        [ ["Armando", "P"], ["Dave", "S"] ],
        [ ["Richard", "R"],  ["Michael", "S"] ],
    ],
    [
        [ ["Allen", "S"], ["Omer", "P"] ],
        [ ["David E.", "R"], ["Richard X.", "P"] ]
    ]
]
In the tournament above Armando will always play P and Dave will always play S. This tournament plays out as follows:

Dave would beat Armando (S>P),
Richard would beat Michael (R>S), and then
Dave and Richard would play (Richard wins since R>S).
Similarly,

Allen would beat Omer,
Richard X would beat David E., and
Allen and Richard X. would play (Allen wins since S>P).
Finally,

Richard would beat Allen since R>S.
Note that the tournament continues until there is only a single winner.

Tournaments can be nested arbitrarily deep, i.e., it may require multiple rounds to get to a single winner. You can assume that the initial tournament is well-formed (that is, there are 2^n players, and each one participates in exactly one match per round).

Write a method rps_tournament_winner that takes a tournament encoded as a bracketed array and returns the winner (for the above example, it should return ["Richard", "R"]).
