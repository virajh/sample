This is one of my VMware based side-projects.

This basically is an application to be used in a virtualized environment based on VMware infrastructure. It is an IP scanner built to produce a mapping of the IPs with the devices assigned that IP.

It takes as input a couple of IP addresses which specify the range to be scanned and a set of login credentials to be used. It will produce a log file to provide the mapping.
